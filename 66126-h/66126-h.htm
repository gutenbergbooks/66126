</div>


<p>Nova Scotia was a sudden inspiration, induced by the
enthusiasm of a friend who had enjoyed a recent vacation
here, and after some correspondence with Nova Scotians
who knew their country, I selected the coast line between
Yarmouth and Halifax.</p>

<p>The afternoon of October 12, 1913, saw me venturing
forth from Boston on the <em>Governor Cobb</em>. The day had
been given over to much rain, but ran dry late in the afternoon,
and my hopes revived, though the evening started
somewhat unprofitably with the moon tucked away in the
attic of cloudland. And the following morning Jupiter
Pluvius helped matters distressfully, having refilled his
tanks over night.</p>

<p>It is a simple thing to reach Nova Scotia from New
York as I went, and not expensive: Fall River Line to
Boston, Yarmouth Line to Yarmouth. A two weeks’ trip
can easily be made for $75 or less.</p>

<p>My adventure started as a walking trip along the coast
line, but quickly resolved itself into a series of short walks
punctuated with railroad rides. Away from the coast all
roads are wood roads, bordered by spruces or other evergreens,
picked out here and there at this season of the
year with a bit of vivid color where the frost has touched
the scrub maple or oak or an occasional white birch. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>shadows are deep and rich and cool, and the odors from
pine and hemlock a delicate perfume that is a constant joy,
but there is little variety in the outlook, as the woods
usually close in on both sides and, while by no means unattractive,
the chief interest and beauty lie along the shore&mdash;hence
the variegated method of my travel.</p>

<p>If I grumble now and then let no one take it too seriously.
Possibly I was tired or hungry, or both&mdash;that always
makes me cross&mdash;and then the weather can easily
account for some of my flings, for it was anything but
charming a goodly part of the time, wet and close&mdash;very
close. I larded the lean earth much of the way as even
Falstaff might envy. The east wind which held day after
day brought many clouds and high fogs which, with a
slender mist that filled the air at times, assisted in making
many exquisite pictures that the camera did its best to
take advantage of, though many times with indifferent
success. The east wind also meant unsettled weather, but
of persistent rain there was little after the first day.</p>

<p>Of the towns which I saw Lockport particularly commended
itself, though Shelburne carries a quaint air of
having once been, which could easily make the visitor
love it. Liverpool and Lunenburg also set out attractions
of their own, but it was the villages and little
wayside stopping places that were the chief delight, such
as Port Latour, Port Mouton, Hunts Point, Port Medway,
Petite Riviere and the wonderful stretches of Dublin Shore
and Western Shore. I speak only of those I saw.</p>

<p>In 1767 Lord William Campbell wrote that Nova<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Scotia has “more ports of safety for ships of any burthen
than any other province of America, and almost at the
entrance of these, inexhaustible mines of fish, which furnish
all Europe with that commodity, and ought to be the first
nursery of seamen to supply, as occasion may require, the
British navy.” In fact this southern coast is almost as
regularly notched with bays and inlets as is the deep-toothed
timber saw.</p>

<p>Many of the smaller hotels give no outward indication
that they are such, but, when found, are apt to prove more
inviting than those of nobler bulk. Here, if one is damp,
he may adjourn to the kitchen and hang his coat near the
fire, talk to the cook (who is usually the landlady or a
daughter of the house), and eat in his shirt sleeves if so
minded. A nice, friendly lot they are&mdash;good, honest people,
to whom it is a pleasure to be obliging. The only exception
I met was at Pubnico, where the landlady tried to
bite my head off, but I adopted General Washington’s famous
Fabian policy and came out with a full stomach and
serene conscience, but I still feel sorry for her old man.</p>

<p>At this season there is much talk of moose and moose
hunting. Listen a moment to any group in hotel or on
street corner and one is reasonably sure to learn how impossible
it was for any man to have made a successful shot
under the circumstances, or what a wonderfully clever shot
it really was. The result guides the conversation.</p>

<p>Everywhere I found pleasant, kindly people, and came
to the conclusion that the Nova Scotia coat of arms should
consist of a smiling face and welcoming hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>One particularly commendable feature of the country
from the point of view of the man on foot is the scarcity
of automobiles. They do have them, but they are few and
far between. Outside of Yarmouth and Halifax I did not
see one during my two weeks’ exploration. It is no trouble
to dodge an ox cart, and one is never surprised into a sudden
dash for the brush by an unexpected toot in the rear.</p>

<p>The roads are good dirt roads and, so far as my observation
went, never deeply rutted, but I presume they
are not what an automobile enthusiast would regard as
even fair, and it is probable that there will be no change
so long as the ox is universally used for hauling, as his
feet with their thin shoes would hardly stand the unelastic
stone road.</p>

<p>“Acadia” is spelled in different ways. I do not cling
to any one spelling, but have rather endeavored to follow
the spelling used at the time which happens to be under
discussion in the narrative.</p>

<p>Samuel de Champlain has described the coast of my
travels, but begins at Lahave and works west, and as I
was bound to the east’ard he cannot well be followed
through the course of the narrative; so, as his description
is interesting, it is included here. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Cape de la Héve, is a place where there is a bay,
where are several islands covered with fir trees, and the
main land with oaks, elms and birches. It is on the shore
of Acadie. * * * Seven leagues from this, is another
called le Port au mouton, where are two small rivers. The
land is very stony, covered with underwood and bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
There is a quantity of rabbits and much game on account
of the ponds there. Going along the coast there is also a
harbor very good for vessels, and the head of it a little
river which runs from a distance inland, which I named
the port of cape Negre, on account of a rock which at a
distance resembles one, which is raised above the water
near a cape that we passed the same day, four leagues
from it and ten to port au mouton. This cape is very dangerous
on account of the rocks around it. The coasts thus
far are very low, covered with the same kind of wood as
cape de la Héve, and the islands all full of game. Going
further on we passed a night in Sable bay where vessels
can lie at anchor without any fear of danger. Cape Sable,
distant two full leagues from Sable bay, is also very dangerous
for certain rocks and reefs lying out a mile almost
to sea. Thence one goes on the isle aux cormorants, a
league distant, so called on account of the infinite number
there of these birds, with whose eggs we filled a cask,
and from this island making westwardly about six leagues,
crossing a bay which runs in two or three leagues to the
northward, we meet several islands, two or three leagues
to sea, which may contain some two others three leagues
and others less according to my judgment. They are
mostly very dangerous for large vessels to come close to
on account of the great tides and rocks level with the
water. These islands are filled with pine trees, firs,
birches and aspens. A little further on are four others.
In one there is so great a quantity of birds called tangueux,
that they may be easily knocked down with a stick. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
another there are seals. In two others there is such an
abundance of birds of different kinds, that without having
seen them could not be imagined, such as cormorants,
ducks of three kinds, geese, marmettes, bustards, perroquets
de mer, snipes, vultures, and other birds of prey,
mauves, sea larks of two or three kinds, herons, goillants,
curlews, sea gulls, divers, kites, appoils, crows, cranes, and
other sorts, which make their nests there. I gave them the
name of the Seal islands. They are distant from the main
land or cape Sable four or five leagues. Thence we go on
to a cape which I called the port Fourchu (Forked harbor)
inasmuch as its figure is so, being five or six leagues distant
from Seal islands. This harbor (Yarmouth?) is very
good for vessels in its entrance but further up it is almost
all dry at low tide with the exception of the course of a
small river, all surrounded by meadows which renders the
place very agreeable.”</p>

<p>Champlain again describes the coast from Lahave eastward:&mdash;</p>

<p>“From leaving cape de la Héve until you reach Sesambre
(Sambro), which is an island so called by some Mallouins,
fifteen leagues distant from La Héve, there are to
be found on the way a quantity of islands, which we have
named “the Martyrs” on account of some Frenchmen
killed by the Indians. These islands are in general cul de
sacs and bays, in one of which there is a river called Sainte
Margueritte, seven leagues distant from Sesambre. The
islands and shores are full of pines, firs, birches, and other
inferior timber. The catch of fish there is abundant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
so is the quantity of birds. From Sesambre we passed a
very safe bay (Chebucto?), containing seven or eight
leagues, where there are no islands in the route except at
the head of it, where there is a small river.”</p>

LAND OF ROMANCE AND MYSTERY</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p120">YARMOUTH TO BARRINGTON.</p>


<p>I have a very proper cousin in the West who, when it
was announced to a waiting world that my precious person
was to be intrusted to the great deep, hastily sent on the
following incident in the life of one who had preceded me:</p>

<p>The facts in the case were about as follows&mdash;Mr. Smith
was to make his first trip abroad and, having heard much
concerning that grievous malady of the sea which is usually
a matter for ribald jest on the part of those kind friends
not afflicted, he concluded to consult a physician. This
learned gentleman advised that, “For a few days before
setting out, eat heartily of everything you enjoy; eat
abundantly.” This did not quite agree with his preconceived
notions, and he concluded to see another doctor, who
advised, “For a few days before you go eat sparingly, almost
starve yourself.” Wholly at sea now, he called in a
third man of medicine, who stated, “Both are right; it
depends entirely on whether you wish to discard from
strength or weakness.” I went to neither extreme myself
and, the sea being calm, suffered no harm.</p>

<p>The only real fault I have to find with this trip is that
too much was attempted. Yarmouth to Halifax does not
look like a great distance on the map, and consequently I
looked up the story of that section, to discover so many
items of interest strewn along the deep indentations of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
rugged coast that it seemed highly improper to allow any
to pass by unobserved. But while a straight line between
the two points is not appalling, to follow the coast line is
much like attempting a trip from the Hudson at Forty-second
street to the opposite point on the East River by
way of the Battery.</p>

<p>I doubt the wisdom of one in my frame of mind spending
an entire day in one town&mdash;it was the open road that
beckoned. But a day had been set apart for Yarmouth,
and as this particular one was never intended for such a
pleasure exertion as mine, owing to its moist condition, it
seems probable that I had planned better than I knew.</p>

<p>The history of Yarmouth appears to have been rather
uneventful, but the public library contains an interesting
relic of prehistoric times in a runic stone discovered on
the west side of the harbor about 1815 by a Doctor
Fletcher, and which the antiquarians after much labor
have translated as “Harko’s son addressed the men.”
The records show that in 1007 the Norsemen made an expedition
along this coast, and one Harki is mentioned
therein, and this and a somewhat similar stone found in
the same general locality in 1897 are supposed to commemorate
some important event of that trip. Nothing
more is known. The stones when discovered were lying
face down in the mud; but for this the action of the elements
would have effaced the lettering during the nine
hundred years that have passed since the work was done.</p>

<p>I called on J. Bond Gray, Secretary of the Tourist Committee
of the Yarmouth Board of Trade, with whom some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
previous correspondence had been held, and on his advice
covered the first nineteen miles, to Argyle, by rail. Mr.
Gray was courteous and pleasant, but in this he but follows
the custom of the land where courtesy is as much a
matter of course as is the glacial boulder. While on this
subject I cannot overlook A. L. Nickerson, station agent.
I unfolded to him my great and consuming desire for a
timetable, as I expected to fall back on the railroad with
more or less frequency. He had none, but appreciating the
situation, said he would do what he could, and during the
day he telegraphed to headquarters in the expectation of
receiving a copy. That he was not successful was no fault
of his, and as a last resort he made a suggestion that enabled
me to secure a copy at another point. This proved
to be the almost universal spirit of the people throughout
the excursion.</p>

<p>The walking actually began on October 14th. The rain
had made desperate efforts during the greater part of the
preceding night to wash Nova Scotia off the map, and when
I alighted from the train at Argyle at 7:54, the morning
was still highly charged with moisture. To the great wonderment
of a gentleman who was spending a quiet hour
with the depot stove I harnessed up and, throwing a rubber
cape over my shoulders, set forth.</p>

<p>Once out in the storm the experience was more than
pleasant. The smell of the fresh dampness was delicious,
and there was a certain exclusiveness in having the highway
all to one’s self that was far from unattractive, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
cleansing which the wayside foliage had undergone made
even the frost-bitten ferns a rich, warm brown.</p>

<p>Of the entire distance to Pubnico, ten miles, the spot
that best pleased my eye is to be located by the first church
steeple after leaving the Argyle station. The small settlement
lies close upon the water at the head of an inlet filled
with beautiful little islands. But all the way through
Lower Argyle the eye is filled with Argyle Sound and its
many islets.</p>

<p>By 10:30 the drizzle was drizzling less and less, and at
one time it seemed as though the sun might get the better
of the situation. A short walk through what had once been
woods, but now is little better than waste land, brought
me to Pubnico and the head of Pubnico Harbor. By this
time my rubber cape had been shed, when the discovery
was made that it was more in the nature of a sieve, as it
was quite as wet inside as out, and that damp feeling which
I had supposed was honest sweat turned out to be nothing
but rainwater. It was quite as penetratingly wet, however.</p>

<p>Pubnico claims to be the oldest Acadian settlement in
Nova Scotia, having been planted by D’Entrement in 1650.
After the expulsion some of the exiles returned, and the
region is still peopled by their descendants, it being commonly
known as the “French Shore.” The houses give no
indication of age, and there is no outward sign to suggest
an old-settled place. Here, as elsewhere, I saw no indications
of extreme poverty; the farms are of little value, but
the fisheries supply every need. The various nationalities
do not mix and disappear in this land as with us. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
all speak the English language the French are still French;
the Germans, German and the Scotch, Scotch. This is so
even where several generations have been born here.</p>

<p>I presented myself at Goodwin’s Hotel, Pubnico, about
11:30 a. m., and found the lady of the house as cross as two
sticks; if it was dinner that was wanted it would be ready
at 12:30, and I could wait for it. Could I have some bread
and milk? No! it took time to get it. She was as sour an
old party as has crossed my path in many a day, and my
heart goes out to any who may fall under her spell.</p>

<p>However, the intervening hour gave an opportunity to
drape myself and clothes around the parlor stove, and as I
discovered a local history, the time was not counted lost.</p>

<p>As I took up the task of searching out East Pubnico
there were to be seen hints of blue in the upper regions of
the air, and it looked as though something better was in
store for the afternoon. Shortly the camera came on an
ox cart and two boys, and we stopped to get acquainted.
It turned out that their motive power was known as
“Spark,” and there seems to be no doubt but that he is
the live wire of the region, as I was reliably informed that
he can make three miles an hour under favoring conditions.</p>

<p>At East Pubnico two ways were open: one through the
nine mile woods, the other around the shore, some twenty-two
miles, and as time was an object and my sailing directions
did not show any stories connected with this portion
of the shore, I picked the former. It proved to be nine
miles without a house or clearing, or even a crossroad&mdash;one
ox team, one light wagon, one bunch of stray cattle and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
few partridges composed all the life I saw. It was a
rather desolate region, some large burned tracts, but most
of it given over to brush and small trees, with an occasional
lake in the distance. It is said that deer are common along
this road and moose occasional, but I did not have the good
fortune to see any.</p>

<p>For a pair of antiquated and out-of-practice legs such
as I had with me, nine miles added to an earlier thirteen,
began to appear like something of an undertaking as the
afternoon wore on, and I communed with myself as to just
why my running gear was being pushed at such a furious
pace, and this a holiday, but did not learn much of interest
except that there I was and thence I must.</p>

<p>Some time later my knees began to squeak and a warm
spot appeared on a little toe, but just at this juncture a
house swung into view and I knew Oak Park was nigh.</p>

<p>It was heartrending to learn that they did not and
would not take boarders, and that the only man who did
in those parts lived a half mile further on. No amount of
looking pleasant had the least effect, and I must compromise
on a glass of water, which my dry and withered
interior sadly needed. Testing my knees gently and finding
that they would bend without breaking, and that my
feet could be lifted and pushed forward if care were exercised,
the journey was again taken up; but why linger
further on the sad scene?</p>

<p>Mr. Charles M. Crowell was counting his chickens when
I arrived. He did not know whether I could stay the night
or not; the old woman had the say on such subjects, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
had gone to see a sister. I said that I would go in and sit
down to wait. The kitchen seemed the warm spot, and I
snuggled up to the stove and was having a nice, comfortable
time when my host dropped in and remarked that there
was no fire in the stove. However, if I wanted one, it was
no trouble, and soon there was a roaring blaze and I began
to steam. When one has been sweating for hours it is a
great comfort to sit close by a fire as the cool of evening
comes on, although it seems quite evident that a good
imagination can be a wonderful aid to comfort. As the
poet has said: “There is nothing either good or bad, but
thinking makes it so.”</p>

<p>Seven o’clock came and went and the better half of
the Crowell family was still absent. I had in the meantime
become intimate with two ginger cookies which, having
been overbrowned in the making, were left on the
kitchen table, but felt that a hard worker like myself could
not live on ginger cookies alone, at least not on two, and
made no attempt to disguise my joy when my hospitable
friend supposed I would like something to eat. He made
tea and gathered up various cold fragments of pie and
cookies, bread and apple-sauce, and we did very well.</p>

<p>The missis came along about nine o’clock, and shortly
thereafter I was dreaming that little devils were twisting
my legs off.</p>

<p>When it was time to depart on the following morning
Mrs. Crowell thought that fifty cents would be sufficient as
the meals had not been very substantial, which was true
enough, but the room was clean and my host and hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
were kindly people, and so far as I was able to judge the
food was sustaining.</p>

<p>The two and one-half miles into Barrington were without
incident, except for a strange bird that crossed my
path. It was not a partridge, nor was it any ordinary
escape from the barnyard. It stood as though its usual
occupation was looking for berries rather than worms, and
walked with a dignity that the domestic hen never possessed.</p>

<p>It is claimed for the old meeting house in Barrington
(1765) that it is the only church in Canada of its age that
has been retained in its original form inside and out;
others that remain have been altered and built over until
little or nothing is left of the original. This only escaped
destruction by a narrow margin, as some time in the
eighties the Legislature decreed that the building should
be demolished, owing to its dangerous condition. But local
pride came to its aid at the last moment, and by the
application of two or three hundred dollars where most
needed, it was put in good repair, and at the present time
two denominations worship every Sunday within its old
fashioned box pews.</p>

<p>Some eighty families from Nantucket and Cape Cod
emigrated to this place between the years 1761 to 1763;
about half remained to form a permanent settlement.
Work was probably commenced on the church shortly after,
as by 1765 the building was finished and dedicated.
With the first settlers came Samuel Wood, a Congregational
pastor. He held services here and at other points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
along the shore as far as Yarmouth, but when the Revolution
broke out, returned to his former home and became a
chaplain in the American army.</p>

<p>In the meantime, about 1770, the New York Methodist
Conference sent Freeborn Garretson to this region to
proselyte. He was received but coldly, however, though
permitted to preach in the meeting house. He failed entirely
to win any converts to his cause, and finally withdrew
to the woods to commune with his Maker. While
offering up his supplications for light and guidance he
was overheard by some of the people, and these, spreading
the report abroad, aroused much curiosity which led to a
considerable attendance when a second meeting was held.
It does not appear, however, that any were deeply impressed.</p>

<p>After those attending the meeting had returned to
their homes a Mrs. Homer asked her less hospitable half
where the minister was stopping, and on being informed
that he did not know, she took a lantern and went forth to
seek him. Either through thoughtlessness, or because
none was quite brave enough to take this expounder of a
strange religion to his home, Mrs. Homer found him at
the meeting house in the act of spreading his surtout on the
floor for a couch. The good lady brought him to her home
and later became his first convert.</p>

<p>All this I have from one who evidently takes a great
interest in the church, but whose name has fallen out of
its proper brain cell and been lost.</p>

<p>Other annals have I none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>At Barrington I made my home at a large square house
just east of the livery stable, rather than at the hotel. The
place was clean, and the meals were good; the hot muffins
were worthy of a poet’s pen. The house was full, chiefly of
commercial men, which would seem to indicate what they
thought of the situation.</p>

<p>I was given the last vacant room, but there came one
after me also seeking lodging, whereupon the landlady
turned to me with the remark that I was his only hope, as
there were two beds in my room. I did as I would have had
him do had the situation been reversed, and found no occasion
for regret. He was a very earnest gentleman, and
amusing withal, much given to conversation not wholly instructive,
though I did learn that silk socks were better for
tired feet than is the more plebian cotton article. I was
so unfortunate as not to secure my companion’s name, but
ascertained that when not devoting his time to greatly increasing
the fortunes of the firm for which he traveled he
resides on the farm of his mother in Yarmouth.</p>

<h2>PORT LATOUR AND BURCHTOWN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Even this early I clearly saw that to walk all the coast
line between Yarmouth and Halifax could not be done at
my leisurely three miles or less per hour. It is three miles
when no pictures intervene or no friendly Nova Scotian
comes along with a ghost story or tale of the seas: Under
such circumstances time is not of the essence of the contract.</p>

<p>It was necessary to visit Port Latour, as here were the
ruins of an old fort to be photographed, and when I saw
“Livery Stable” writ large across a Barrington barn,
there came the thought that this was a Heaven sent opportunity
to economize time, the twenty miles to Port Latour
and back could be more easily accomplished and abundant
time remain for the visit. But no one was about the stable.
A call on a neighboring house elicited the information that
the livery man was driving a commercial individual to some
far hamlet, while his chief and only understudy was employed
in like manner in another direction. Finally a man
was found on the road who thought he could harness the
one horse left, but when it came to a conveyance he hesitated.
Of the two on hand one was new and undefiled, the
other freshly painted, so he suggested that I take his open
wagon, as mud could not harm it, and the horse was led
to his barn, where the operation of hitching up was completed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
No credentials on my part appeared to be necessary,
not even my name was asked, nor did I ask the price
until evening came, when I learned that the charge was
$1.50 for the day.</p>

<p>The road follows the shore of Barrington Bay as far
as Villagedale (formerly Solid Rock), then crosses to the
eastern side of the point where reposes Port Latour. The
morning was full of sunshine, the spruces and hemlocks
made strong shadows against the high lights of the sun
illumined landscape, while many pleasant views over Barrington
Bay charmed the hours away.</p>

<p>Solid Rock (not the village, but the rock) is possibly
two-thirds of the ten miles to Port Latour, and must be
inquired for to be found, as the spot lies on the shore a
quarter mile from the road and across a farm. It is
merely a group of unusually large granite boulders against
which the waves break, the surroundings are extremely
beautiful and a rugged lane that covers part of the distance
is captivating in its primitive simplicity. In itself it was
worth the entire trip. Words would be a mere catalogue
of its component parts; they cannot describe it as it appeared
on that brilliant afternoon when the depths of the
hemlock shadows were almost black.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with the Latour House is confined to
a dinner, and I know not what the rooms are like. But I
know what the people are like and that, with the dinner to
back them, is enough. William B. Crowell, the proprietor,
unharnessed my horse, put him in the stable and gave him
a feed of hay, and when I wished to return walked a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
quarter mile from his boatshop to harness up, and all he
wanted was ten cents for the hay. I only had five cents and
a quarter; he had no change, and positively refusing the
quarter, accepted the smaller coin perfectly satisfied that
he had done the proper thing, and his wife who runs the
house may still be his better half. Her chicken dinner was
good right down to the last mouthful, the charge was but
thirty-five cents, and I could not force a half dollar on her.</p>

<p>A pleasant, friendly, unmercenary spirit seems to be
the usual thing throughout this coast region of Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p>This village is charmingly simple, inhabited by a race
of sailormen with whom it is not difficult to become acquainted,
the Atlantic coast is at the door, and I have no
doubt but that a week here would pass as a puff of steam
on a dry day.</p>

<p>Now for our history. Claude Turgis de Sainte Etienne,
Sieur de la Tour and his son Charles de la Tour left France
in 1606, when the son was fourteen years of age, to mend
their fortunes in the new world. After one Argal ravaged
these coasts in 1613 and destroyed the French settlements,
Charles attached himself to one Biencourt and lived with
him among the Indians. Biencourt, when dying, bequeathed
to Charles his rights in Port Royal (now Annapolis),
and named him as successor in command. This
is 1623.</p>

<p>During the next four years Charles lived in Fort Saint
Louis at Cape Sable on a harbor called Port Lomeron (or
L’Omeroy), now Port Latour. About 1625-6 Charles wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to Louis <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr>., asking to be appointed commandant in all
the coasts of Acadie. This letter was intrusted to the
father, Claude, who started for France, but on the way
was captured and carried to England. Claude was a
Huguenot, and in London met others of like faith. These
persuaded him to renounce France and take up the cause
of England. He married an English woman, was made a
Baronet of Nova Scotia, receiving a like honor for his son,
and engaged to deliver to England Fort Saint Louis, then
being held by Charles for France. With this object in view
two men-of-war were fitted out for him, and with his wife
he turned his face toward the new world once more.</p>

<p>Arriving (1627) Claude landed and presented his case
to the son in the full assurance that the latter would
promptly accept the situation and the new honors which
would flow therefrom, but Charles seems to have been only
half La Tour, the other half, much the better, probably
represented his mother, and he confounded his father with
the following melodramatic effusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If those who sent you on this errand think me capable
of betraying my country, even at the solicitation of a
parent, they have greatly mistaken me. I am not disposed
to purchase the honors now offered me by committing a
crime. I do not undervalue the proffer of the King of
England; but the Prince in whose service I am is quite
able to reward me; and whether he does so or not, the inward
consciousness of my fidelity to him will be in itself
a recompense to me. The King of France has confided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
defense of this place to me. I shall maintain it, if attacked,
till my latest breath.”</p>

<p>Claude then threatened the obstinate boy and finally
attacked the fort, but Charles defended his post with such
success that the English commanding officer, who had not
counted on resistance, having lost several of his best
soldiers, informed Claude that he would abandon the siege.</p>

<p>William E. Smith of Port Latour, whose ancestors have
dwelt here for many generations, told me that an older
member of the family who died some years ago, and who
knew much of the early history of the region, had stated
that Claude La Tour at first attacked the fort from his
ships, and being unsuccessful in this, sailed around into
Barrington Bay, where he landed his men at or near Solid
Rock, and marched them across to attack the fort in the
rear.</p>

<p>A small, swampy strip immediately north of the fort is
said to have been caused by the digging of a trench in which
those who fell in the battle were buried.</p>

<p>Claude was placed in a most embarrassing position.
He could not well return to England, much less to France.
He had no money or men, and the only course left to him
was to appeal to his son’s clemency. He presented the
situation to his wife and suggested that she return to England,
but she preferred to accept what might come to her
husband. Claude then applied to his son for permission to
live in Acadie, which appears to have been readily granted,
but it was stipulated that neither he nor his wife were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
come into the fort, though Charles gave his word that neither
should want for anything.</p>

<p>The terms were hard, but there was no alternative and,
with the permission of the English commander, Claude and
his wife and servants disembarked with all their belongings
and the two vessels returned to England. Charles caused
a suitable house to be erected at some distance from the fort
and took care of their maintenance. M. Denys relates that
he found them there in 1635, and that they were well off.</p>

<p>The story seems to have been patched together from
several accounts of the settlements along this coast which
differ in some details. One account states that after the
battle Claude sailed to Port Royal and came back later at
the invitation of Charles, who hoped to persuade his father
to break his alliance with England and tell what he
knew of the condition of the English. And, having now
no great expectations from his adopted country, Claude
accepted the invitation and told Charles that the English
were preparing to capture his fort. On this the La Tours
and other Frenchmen took council among themselves and
decided to form a settlement at the mouth of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
River, Claude to command there and Charles to continue at
his old post.</p>

<p>At the time of the expulsion, 1755, the fort was destroyed
and the village wiped out. And to-day nothing remains
but a few grass grown mounds. These have been
excavated to some extent, but nothing was found beyond
a few clay pipes and other matters of small moment. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of the Acadians who wandered back after the expulsion are
said to have established themselves in Pubnico.</p>

<p>That my time should be used to the best advantage, a
train was taken at Barrington for Burchtown, originally a
settlement of colored people who escaped into the English
lines in New York during the Revolution. This lies some
seven miles west of Shelburne; these miles are chiefly
through woods, much of which has been desolated by forest
fires, and looks as forlorn as a tramp attempting to shut
out the winter winds with a covering of newspapers. It
was a pleasant change to come out on the Roseway River,
even though this meant sawmills, which are eating the
heart out of the woodlands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SHELBURNE_AND_THE_ROAD_TO_EAST_JORDAN">SHELBURNE AND THE ROAD TO EAST JORDAN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Shelburne has a history that is peculiarly interesting
to the people of the United States, as it was settled by
Loyalist refugees immediately after the Revolutionary
War.</p>

<p>Colonel Alexander McNutt about 1765 secured a grant
of land at Port Razoir, and arrived from Ireland with
about three hundred settlers. He called the place New
Jerusalem, but Colonel McNutt seems to have been an obstreperous
gentleman and his little settlement was in almost
constant hot water, and within a short time boiled
down to a small residuum.</p>

<p>In the year 1782 one hundred heads of families in New
York, sympathizers with the English cause, bound themselves
to settle in Nova Scotia. These were led to believe
that the city which they were to establish would become
the capital of the Province, and many men of wealth and
position were among them. All were respectable; no
family was admitted unless some member could vouch for
its good reputation. Within a year four hundred and seventy
heads of families had signed and on May 4, 1783,
eighteen brigs and many schooners dropped anchor off New
Jerusalem and landed five thousand persons.</p>

<p>On July 20th Governor Parr arrived at the new settlement
and, having landed, proceeded up King street to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the place appointed for his reception. This may have been
what is now known as the “Governor’s House,” as it is
said to be so called because some Governor made a speech
from its steps. Here he made a short address in which he
signified his intention of calling the place Shelburne. On
the 23d he dined in the house of Justice Robertson with
the principal inhabitants.</p>

<p>About September a second hegira of Loyalists arrived
from New York. Many of these were undesirable characters
who lowered the tone of the place greatly. Others
followed, and within a short time there were sixteen thousand
inhabitants settled here, nine thousand of which
drew government rations. At the end of four years the
government rations ceased, and as the place could not support
so many, it began to dwindle. In 1798 a storm which
destroyed wharves and shipping made matters worse, and
by 1818 Shelburne was reduced to three hundred inhabitants.</p>

<p>About 1855 ship-building began to be an important industry,
and the place took an upward turn. In 1864 an
academy was built, but the day of the wooden ship is passing,
and while Shelburne still has two small yards where
fishermen are built, the town has dwindled again and is
now a delightfully sleepy old place where one can lounge
on a box at the smithy door or on a bit of timber near some
growing fisherman and harken if he will to tales of the
good old times.</p>

<p>On the way into Shelburne I passed a beautiful clump
of goldenrod whose waiting seed vessels were as a halo in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the bright sunlight, and shortly after turning the corner
came upon the picturesque disorder of a shipyard framed
between the stubs of willows whose aged trunks suggested
that they might date back two hundred years. The scene
aroused huge anticipations in the breast of the camera.</p>

<p>After a dinner in the Atlantic House I proceeded to
ask questions of such as were gathered in the hotel office
concerning the town. One of those present offered to pilot
me about, and we ventured forth together. The Governor’s
House is still standing on King street; the only other old
house that my guide seemed to know of is the “Thompson”
house. When it was built or by whom I did not learn, but
it is supposed to have been erected at an early period, as
the walls of the lower story are solid wood, some six or
eight inches in thickness, presumably made so for defensive
purposes.</p>

<p>Being left to my own guidance I naturally selected
the waterfront, where quite soon was discovered a boat
shop that was at the moment turning out dories, presumably
part of the equipment of a fishing schooner, the hull
of which was nearing completion in an adjoining shipyard.</p>

<p>The weather conditions were ideal for pictorial effects.
A sky filled with damp clouds and a misty atmosphere that
graduated the distance lent themselves to some beautiful
and striking pictures; particularly was this so when the
clouds thinned and the sun almost broke through. The east
wind was very successful as a scene-shifter, rumpling the
water in a gentle way while pushing the cloud masses on
and off as they were needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>My travels finally brought me to the blacksmith’s shop
of one who is now living on the fruit of his earlier industry.
In the long ago he cared for the feet of the stagecoach
horses, and as they had a way of wanting to be shod at all
hours of the day and night, the mighty man worked overtime
more often than not. Now he directs while others do
the heavy work, or stands at the door of his shop and entertains
callers.</p>

<p>As I stood here helping to shoe an ox the “cow-reeve”
passed. This is a duly elected official of the town in whom
is vested authority to comprehend all “vagrom” cows that
may be leading too gay an existence in the streets of Shelburne.
These he removes to the pound and shares with
the poundmaster such emolument as comes from the sad
faced owner of the segregated cow.</p>

<p>As the “cow-reeve” passed there was a great flood of
strong language from those idling about, from which I gathered
that he was not the most popular man in town; in fact
he was more than once invited to go where only the bad are
supposed to abide&mdash;not conscientious officials who do their
duty. It was further suggested that if he desired to have
the contour of his nose or other features altered he should
attempt to interfere with the oxen awaiting in the open
street the attentions of the blacksmith, but he, being a man
of peace, opened not his mouth.</p>

<p>And it was thus that I discovered what a “cow-reeve”
was. It seems that this official in his zeal for the public
good had, a few days before, attempted to uphold the
majesty of the law as against the owners of certain oxen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
but when the said owners charged on him he discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>Shoeing an ox is somewhat more complicated and tedious
than shooing a hen, but the effects are more lasting.
A strong cage is constructed that no ox may break down;
the animal is then coaxed within with much noise and slapping,
bars are closed on his neck, a heavy cloth is passed
beneath the body, one end being pulled aft between his
legs. This end and the side are then attached to windlasses
which are set up until the ox might easily suppose
he is being fitted with a new pair of corsets. The hoof to
be shod is next strapped securely to a block, and the incumbent
is about as helpless as the first Frenchman in the
ditch at Waterloo. After that the shoeing is a mere detail.</p>

<p>The only milestone that I observed during the trip intimated
broadly that the miles were twenty-one between
Shelburne and Lockport, but I am inclined to believe it
somewhat less; for instance, I had only joggled six miles
out of the pedometer at Jordan, while those of the neighborhood
called it seven. It may be that some time someone
in authority has said, “Let there be seven,” and it was
seven. All day the pedometer fell just a little short of the
local figures.</p>

<p>At Jordan I met three children homing from school,
and with <em>Venator</em>, Izaak Walton’s chance acquaintance,
could have said, “We are all so happy as to have a fine,
fresh, cool morning, and I hope we shall each be the happier
in the other’s company. And that I may not lose
yours, I shall either abate or amend my pace to enjoy it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
knowing that as the Italians say, ‘Good company in a journey
makes the way to seem the shorter.’” It seemed that
teacher had gone to her home for Thanksgiving, which occurs
in this land on October 20th, and as there is but one
train each day and that chanced along some time before
noon, the natural consequence was that school was dismissed
at an early hour.</p>

<p>We discoursed of many things of mutual interest: The
surprising fact that in the far country from which I came
Thanksgiving does not occur until late in November; the
joys of skating; apples; the bumps one receives in this
naughty world, this being somewhat personal to the small
boy of the party, who had but recently fallen on stony
ground and was at the moment nursing a swollen lip. The
scene of the accident being near at hand we stepped one
side to view it and, having found the identical stone that
proved so hard, proceeded on our way. They were quite
as ready to be friendly as I, and accepted the stranger as
a matter of course without wonder, and made no attempt
to learn why I was as I was; we had our little jokes and
our hearty laughs and walked thus together for perhaps
half a mile, and I think were none the worse for a little light
conversation.</p>

<p>At East Jordan I pulled up at the house of Munroe with
a hopeful expression on my countenance, and was told by
the mistress of the house that she would do the best she
could. This consisted of bread and butter, pickled beets,
milk and two kinds of cookies, was filling and, so far as I
have been able to judge, nourishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Munroe has thirteen to look after, and at the time
was cooking enough to last most of them a week in the
woods, where they will cut pulpwood. Norma, the eldest of
eleven, is now a trained nurse in Boston, and earns $25
each week. The local doctor says there is not another girl
in the county with as little education as she had a chance
to secure who could have passed the examination. “You
know the eldest child in a large family does not have great
opportunity for education.” Norma spent three weeks at
home last summer, but could not stand it longer. A smart
little shower passed to the westward while the lunch was
being disposed of, the only one that occurred during the
day.</p>

<p>My course from East Jordan lay through woods; one
glimpse over the head of Green Harbor was the only variation.
If one can judge by the names of places the people
here have no great inventive faculty. For instance, the five
towns on Jordan Bay are Jordan, Jordan Ferry, Jordan
Bay, Lower Jordan Bay and East Jordan.</p>

<p>The ox, which is the common carrier of this region, is
seen everywhere on the road, always harnessed to a yoke
which is fitted around the horns so that all the pull comes
on the neck. The Biblical injunction, “Be ye not stiff
necked as your fathers were” would never do for Nova
Scotian oxen, whose value would be greatly lessened were
they other than stiff necked as their fathers were. Their
beautiful, great, soft eyes indicate a habit of thought that
would hardly make them entertaining companions, but they
accomplish much heavy hauling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>One has much time to moralize thusly while plodding
along the wood roads that for the most part offer little to
the imagination, unless a partridge whirrs up and over the
treetops or scurries through the brush, as sometimes occurs.</p>

<p>One who picked me up about two miles out of Lockport
and regaled me with much talk by the way, had somewhat
to say concerning his father-in-law, a native of these
parts, but to his way of thinking made of a superior brand
of clay.</p>

<p>During the days of the Fenian raid along in the sixties,
when all up and down the coast there was much excitement,
a stranger appeared on this shore against whom the
people with one accord shut their doors, dreading they
knew not what. After being rebuffed at several houses he
finally sought shelter with father-in-law who, fearing nothing,
promptly took him in and learned in the course of time
that the visitor was of Prince Edward Island, that his
brother-in-law had been arrested for smuggling, and that
he was the only witness against him. If he could keep in
hiding until after the trial there could be no conviction,
and as his host had little sympathy with government efforts
to suppress the illicit traffic, the stranger was kept within
his gates until he could safely return unto his own people.
Ever after when he of the sheltering hand visited the home
land of the former refugee, he was received with open
arms and entertained with the best.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LOCKPORT_AND_THE_WAY_TO_LIVERPOOL">LOCKPORT AND THE WAY TO LIVERPOOL.</h2>
</div>


<p>At Lockport I put up at Mrs. Mack’s “New Hillcrest,”
from which it is but “two minutes’ walk to the celebrated
Lockport beach,” a pebbly, crescent shaped stretch, where
the waves break well out, owing to the shoal water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mack is a large success from the point of view
of the traveler. Here I had the best supper of the entire
trip, oyster stew and roast chicken, each in perfection, and
was told by one who had spent three weeks under her hospitable
roof that it was always the same. On entering the
house there is a pleasant home air that is charming. That
her place is full all summer, and that she rooms large numbers
outside, is the logical result of her methods.</p>

<p>The day was very dull and the light none too good for
the camera, but after leaving my excess baggage with my
hostess, I soon found the way to the cold storage dock where
fishermen were preparing signals and buoys for an expedition
to the Banks. The slip was well filled with small
vessels; fishermen, judging from the dories and trawl tubs
nested on their decks, and the activity was interesting to
a layman, but owing to weather conditions the camera did
not enthuse much.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years ago Dr. Jonathan Lock of
Chilmark, Mass., and Josiah Churchill settled here.
Throughout the Revolution the settlers refrained from active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
hostilities. Apparently their sympathies were with
the struggling states, and it can well be imagined that their
feelings as well as pockets were much hurt when, in 1779,
American privateers came on shore and looted the town.
The indignant protest which the townsmen uttered and
which is still to be found in the archives of Massachusetts,
is given in full:&mdash;</p>

<p>
“Raged Islands, Sept. W. 25, 1779.<br />
</p>

<p>“These lines comes with my respect to you &amp; to acquaint
you of the Robery done to this Harbour, there was
a guard of men placed upon every house and the houses
stript, very surprising to us, they came here early in the
Morning on the 20th day of August last and said they were
from Penobscot and were tories bound for halifax, they
come to my house first and wanted some refreshments accordingly
we let them have what they wanted, and they
then went away and stayed on an island till the tide run
so that they could Come at my Boat, then they came and
took my Boat and put a guard upon my house and went a
Robing they took about 19 quintals of Codfish and Four
Barrels of Salt, three Salmon Netts 60 lbs. of Butter, one
Green Hyde, five dressed Skins and some Cheese and a
Great many other Things. The Boat cost me fifty pounds
Halifax Currency. Then they went to Mr. Matthews and
there Robed him, then went to Mr. Haydens, and Robed
him, then went Mr. Locks and Robed him. These things
are very surprising that we in this Harbour that have done
so much for America, that have helped three or four hundred
prisoners up along to America and Given part of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
living to them, and have Concealed Privateers &amp; prizes
too from the British Cruisers in this Harbour. All this
done for America and if this be the way we are to be paid
I desire to see no more of you without you Come in Another
Manner, but I hope the America gentlemen that
Grants out Commissions or are Bondsmen would take
these Notorious Rascalls in hand for this Robery. Sir be
so kind as to Inform some of the Council of the affair, that
we might have some restrictions, otherwise we shall not
be able to help the American prisoners any more. Sir, if
you find out who these be, and whether we are like to have
anything, be pleased to write.</p>

<p>During the War of 1812 a hostile ship approached Lockport
at a time when the men were away, but the women
and children formed themselves in martial array with red
coats and broomsticks, and lined up on the bluff, while
others marched up and down with a drum; still other patriotic
souls fired such available muskets and fowling
pieces as were to be had, and the local historian concludes
his account with the statement that “the enemy made good
their escape.”</p>

<p>Lockport is a considerable fishing headquarters. Here
the “cod flakes” are set up wherever a vacant space occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in the village. “Cod flakes” are low racks on which
the split cod are spread to dry in the sun. An important
adjunct to these is a sufficient number of boxes that look
like children’s toy houses with hip roofs, under which the
cod are collected in damp weather. Many of these were
set up on the grassy slope in front of the hotel. On my
arrival the cod were housed from the damp weather, and
I did not suspect their presence until the following morning
when the boxes were lifted and their contents spread
to catch the heat of the recently emancipated sun.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful bits of land and water encountered
during the trip was the southernmost point of
Lockport (when I say “most beautiful,” it is well to remember
that I saw but a small part of the coast line). The
visit calls for a walk of a half mile across fields and through
a bit of gnarled, storm-beaten woods out over a rough
scrap of moorland, where the moss lies inches deep and
the walking is a delicious little experience, to a rocky
point against which the Atlantic sweeps without hindrance.
A few timorous cows browsing among the hillocks run as
the stranger approaches, or, standing at a safe distance,
gaze on the intruder with a curious, uncertain attitude
strongly reminding one of Rosa Bonheur’s highland cattle,
though lacking something of the dignity of these.
Close at hand the ocean swells and breaks against the
rocky point, while beyond lies the level horizon line that is
only broken by an occasional sail. For one who would be
alone with nature and the elements it is a choice spot.</p>

<p>The railroad only comes within four miles of Lockport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and a ferry fills the gap. This crosses the bay to Hast
Side for the accommodation of those living in that remote
neighborhood, and then recrosses to the depot landing, affording
a good opportunity to see the harbor. As one ferry
trip does duty for both east and west bound trains, and
they differ in their coming to the extent of an hour, there
was abundant opportunity to study the travelers, some on
their way to Florida for the winter and some bound for
their daily bread in New England ports.</p>

<p>A center of attraction was a freshly killed moose which
had been shot the day before about four miles from the
station and brought in that morning; as my knowledge of
mooseology is limited, I do not know whether his small
horns indicated a young animal or not. The hunter was
much pleased at the thought of being photographed with
his game, and promptly unlashed the head from the bottom
of the wagon and pulled it around where it would show to
better advantage.</p>

<p>It had been my original intention to take a train to
Port Mouton (pronounced <em>Ma-toon</em>) and walk from there
to Liverpool, but the clouds began to scowl and the walk
was shortened by keeping on to Hunts Point on the eastern
shore of Mouton Bay.</p>

<p>Mouton is French for sheep. In 1604 the Sieur de
Monts lost a sheep here, which jumped overboard from his
ship, and such an impression did the loss of that precious
mutton make that the name has survived for more than
three hundred years. As the train skirted the beach a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
sandy crescent could be seen on which the waves
were charging with their white horses leaping high.</p>

<p>Hunts Point is a small fishing station with another
curving sand beach, but while some miles nearer the open
ocean, in fact, almost directly on it, the surf by no means
equaled that at Port Mouton&mdash;it was rather the gentle ripple
of a summer sea. At the southern extremity of the
crescent is grouped a picture-compelling cluster of fish
warehouses and wharves that gives an unusual finish to
the view. The camera considered it for some minutes, but,
strange to say, refused to even attempt it. The place is
well worth a visit though, under another lighting and a
different state of the tide it might be another picture altogether.</p>

<p>The seven miles to Liverpool was uneventful except for
a beautiful brook that dashes from the woods and all but
pounces on the road. Fortunately it drops into a stillwater
and glides off at a right angle just in time to save the highway.
As to the remainder of the way, it would no doubt
have been more interesting had I traveled in the direction
of Western Head, and so along the shore of Liverpool Bay
through Black Point, but as it was the shades of night
had been pulled down before my destination was reached.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LIVERPOOL_PORT_MEDWAY_AND_BEYOND">LIVERPOOL, PORT MEDWAY AND BEYOND.</h2>
</div>


<p>At Lockport I met S. E. Mack of Lunenburg, who is in
the Customs Service, and who took a live interest in my
method of seeing the country. He suggested the Daniels
House as a comfortable place to spend Sunday, and while
its management had changed hands since he knew it last, I
found it quite satisfactory. The Mersey House here is
claimed to be one of the best in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Charles Warman, a resident of Liverpool, has written
much concerning the town’s history and has tramped Nova
Scotia from end to end in search of local lore. I found
him at work on the journal of Col. Simeon Perkins, but he
was quite ready to defer his own work and give me attention.
A walk about the town under his guidance resulted
in much that proved of interest.</p>

<p>In 1605 the Sieur de Monts was made Lieutenant-General
of Nova Scotia by Henry <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>. A year before this he,
in company with Champlain, sailed along this coast. This
locality he named Port Rossignal, after a certain adventurous
gentleman who was caught poaching on his preserves
here, and whose vessel he confiscated. Later the
region was included in La Tour’s grant known as La Héve;
the settlements were small and not permanent.</p>

<p>The present town of Liverpool was founded in 1759 by
New England pioneers. That they were an energetic lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
is thought proven by the fact that within a year they were
building three vessels for the fisheries to add to a fleet that
already contained sixteen schooners. One of their leaders
was Capt. Sylvanus Cobb, who had been master and owner
of one of the vessels that removed the Acadians from
Grand-Pré in 1755.</p>

<p>In 1779 American privateers were a constant source of
annoyance and damage, but “the thrifty Yankee of Liverpool
concluded to make hay while the sun shines. So in
due time they had a fine fleet of privateers harrying the
New England waters for the spoils of war, and the practice
was returned, but these Nova Scotians got the better
of the game, and several families, who were very plain
people before, became persons of consequence on this
money that had been taken from their own flesh and blood”&mdash;so
says a Nova Scotia historian.</p>

<p>Whether an acquaintance I made in Port Medway has
a gentle little grudge against Liverpool, or whether it is
commendable local jealousy, I am not quite clear, but he
takes this view of it: “As a result of this privateering
certain of the people of Liverpool grew wealthy, built a
string of houses along the main street and held themselves
up as aristocrats, and some of their descendants still think
they are made of better clay than the average.”</p>

<p>The War of 1812 proved another blessing to the freebooters,
as did that between England, France and Spain.</p>

<p>Smuggling was another popular fad, and anyone who
interfered was more than apt to get himself disliked. In
1782 a certain citizen had the reputation of being an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>former,
and about the time that this reputation became
firmly established, or shortly thereafter, the Provisional
Government was offering a reward for the conviction of
the person or persons who cut off the ears of the said citizen.
It does not appear to be a matter of record that the
reward was ever collected, the informer business having become
extremely unpopular.</p>

<p>A fort which is now a public park that adorns the
southern end of the town does not appear to have been
much more useful in the early days, as we are told that in
1780 it was captured by an unexpected night attack led by a
Yankee named Benjamin Cole. With their fort in the
hands of the enemy and the place commanded by the guns
of the privateer, the situation looked hopeless to the townsmen&mdash;all
but Col. Simeon Perkins. Getting out of difficulties
appears to have been one of the Colonel’s chief delights,
and he proceeded to make arrangements for the
capture of the invading Cole while on his way through the
town. The attempt was successful, and with him safely in
hand, Colonel Perkins “was enabled to dictate to the
enemy most favorable terms of redress, capitulation and
retreat. So ended the Siege of Liverpool.”</p>

<p>One of the interesting items Mr. Warman had just
transcribed from the journal of Simeon Perkins was dated
October 3, 1774. It reads: “John Thomas who took three
hundred pounds of tea from here lost the whole lot by the
Sons of Liberty at Plymouth destroying it on deck.” This
piece of news had been brought from Plymouth by Joshua
Battle, who came to Liverpool for “boards.” Mr. Warman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
states that it is a fact not generally known that two of
the vessels raided for tea in Boston harbor were from this
port.</p>

<p>Another interesting item dated August 3, 1776, is the
recording of a rumor to the effect that General Washington
had been made a prisoner.</p>

<p>The home of Simeon Perkins, erected by him in 1766,
still stands back from the main street in a fine state of
preservation. Another interesting old home is that of
Capt. Bartlett Bradford, which is situated well out toward
the fort. The Captain was a privateer of note and a
prominent man in the community. This house was the
first custom house (1790), Joshua Newton occupying it for
that purpose.</p>

<p>A story which Mr. Warman has never used because he
has not been able to verify it, has to do with the apparition
of a Capt. Nathaniel Freeman. The Captain’s wife called
on Simeon Perkins one day and said she had seen her husband
during the night, when he appeared before her in his
uniform with a bloody spot on his breast; she feared he
had been killed. Two months later the news was brought
to Liverpool that he had been killed in some fight at the
very hour that his wife had seen him. Ghosts no doubt have
their use and are intended for some good and wise purpose,
but here was one whose only object appears to have
been trouble; the two months must have been a trying
time. Suppose the widow had just purchased a new scarlet
petticoat, what a state of mind she must have been in.
The call was neither nice nor necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Here is the story of Gerb Doggett of Liverpool, as I
gathered it from a fellow-traveler between Shelburne and
Lockport. Gerb Doggett was a bad man&mdash;very bad. Gerb
was a canner of lobsters. Whether canning lobsters deteriorates
the morals of one so engaged has not been determined;
he may have been naturally wicked and have
utilized his solitary trips up and down the coast, when purchasing
lobsters, for the thinking out of schemes whereby
he could excel in evil deeds. Be this as it may, Gerb gave
up the canning business and took a correspondence course
in smuggling.</p>

<p>Having learned well the best methods employed in his
new trade, he did not invest any of his own money in a vessel,
but chartered a schooner and went buccaneering for
whisky to the French settlement of Saint Pierre, off Newfoundland.
The first effort was highly successful. The
whisky was run in under cover of a dark night and quickly
disposed of, but some meddlesome little bird whispered to
the revenue officials that there were queer doings along-shore,
and they kept a weather eye out, so to speak. Gerb,
all unconscious of impending evil, secured a second cargo
by which he hoped to put away a certain portion of this
world’s goods for that rainy day that we all fear, and which
was somewhat nearer at hand than he anticipated.</p>

<p>Just how it was my informant did not make clear, but in
some way Gerb learned that those in authority were on his
wake, and he had only time enough to land in some lonely
cove along the Strait of Canso, bury the casks in the sand
and put to sea. The pursuit was kept up, however, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the smuggler found it necessary to abandon his vessel and
drop out of sight, and he has not been known in these parts
since. The innocent owners lost their schooner, which was
confiscated by an unfeeling government, and thus was the
wisdom of Gerb, whose own money was not in the vessel,
illustrated.</p>

<p>October 20th is the Nova Scotian Thanksgiving Day.
The shipyard near the eastern end of the bridge apparently
had a hurry job, as work was in full blast, but elsewhere the
holiday was being observed.</p>

<p>A wet fog hurried in from the sea to prevent me from
acquiring any sort of a view of the surrounding waters,
but the dim outline of the Brooklyn breakwater with a few
vessels sheltered back of it brought to mind a statement
made by Mr. Warman that here was the fishing station of
that unfortunate Captain Rossignol, who was caught by
de Monts in the act of catching fish that a king three thousand
miles away had given to his retainer. It was a rather
empty return that the captor made to name the bay after
his victim.</p>

<p>After passing the turn for Millvillage I was cautioned
twice to take the left road at the next fork, and did so, to
discover too late that I had thereby missed the shore road.
However, a hunter informed me that three miles had been
saved, and the fog was so dense that the shore road would
no doubt have been a mere aggravation, while among the
trees the mist afforded some beautiful effects. The camera
eagerly grasped at these, but mostly failed in its good
intent. The more distant trees were the ghosts of trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
while those at hand, a dark, somber mass of green, stood
strong against the misty background. An occasional tall
white birch with its crown of gold melted into the unreal
atmosphere.</p>

<p>I started two partridges at one point, and at another a
big, brown bunny hopped across the road in a leisurely
fashion that made it perfectly evident he was aware that
I had no gun. It being a holiday the hunters were out. I
passed several, and occasionally heard the boom of a distant
gun, suggesting that another partridge was on his
way to the roasting pan.</p>

<p>And thus passed pleasantly the ten miles to Port Medway.</p>

<p>Port Medway has my heart, as have also its girls&mdash;at
least, two of them. The traveler comes into the village
quite suddenly, to find the houses snuggled down close
along little coves, each man his cove. As the village is further
penetrated it is to find that the waters have worked
long fingers up into the land until many houses back on
the water, as well as front on it. An artist might find
more to do here in a minute than would keep him busy for
a year, it is all so sketchy.</p>

<p>Now for the girls: There are two of them, as plump
and bright and pleasant as one could ask. My heart went
smash immediately, torn between the two, even if one
was married. They allowed me to come out in the
kitchen, hang my damp coat over a chair and eat in my
shirtsleeves. Both could talk and neither made any undue
protestations at being photographed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>If any one desires a choice spot for a vacation let him
try the Kempton House, Port Medway, Queens Co., N. S.,
and forever after be filled with pleasant memories. The
board is $5 per week. I asked if they fed all as they were
feeding me, and had a laugh and “yes” for answer.</p>

<p>When I began to ask questions concerning the locality
Mr. J. N. Wilde was called in to assist, Mr. Jason Kempton,
fountain head of all knowledge, being away from home.</p>

<p>My information is to the effect that Port Medway was
settled about one hundred and seventy-five years ago by
immigrants from Cape Cod. Why they came Mr. Historian
does not know, but he surmises that they were the
unsuccessful ones at home and, having nothing to lose by
the change, could afford to make it. One of the early ones
was a Cohoon, whose seed multiplied in the land until about
one hundred years ago the family was numerous and
prominent. The same is to be said of the Foster and
Morine families, but the last century has seen them dwindle
until few of these names are left.</p>

<p>I could not learn that the town had ever had any adventures;
if it has they have been carefully hidden from Mr.
Wylde, who is a reasonably free talker.</p>

<p>In passing I would record the fact that in Port Medway
lies the first stone wall or fence, such as is so common with
us, that has come within the compass of this walk.</p>

<p>From here I was to ferry to Voglers Cove. My ferryman
had the face of a poet with the blond, silky little beard
that fits so well such a face, but the hands were those of
a hard worker. A soft voice; pleasant, talkative and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
kindly, I was so sure that he must have at least one baby
tucked away at home that I tried to give him a quarter to
get the child a little present. But, alas! he had none.</p>

<p>The run across to Voglers Cove, which is possibly a matter
of four miles, was made in a motor boat whose cranky
engine balked, as is the habit of these descendants of the
mule. It was interesting to see what patience and perseverance
could do with such a loose-jointed affair.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Voglers Cove I came on Jason Conrad
and his ox cart, and as the background seemed propitious,
the camera proceeded to its duty. Jason being of
an inquiring turn of mind, hauled up to see what it was
all about and, having learned, proceeded to give me his
life history, which I unfortunately did not attempt to record
until only a few fragments remained to be gathered up.</p>

<p>He had been to sea some sixty years and three times
thought the good Lord had him, but each time managed to
escape. His old woman has stomach trouble very bad, like
heartburn right here (illustrating); doctors could do
nothing for her, but he had some very fine old Jamaica
rum which cured her. After that she had the trouble so
frequently that the rum was soon exhausted, and he has
not been able to get any more as good. Used to drink himself
some in his earlier days. “You know how it is with
sailors.” Like his namesake of long ago, he appears to
have sown his share of dragons’ teeth. New York is a
damn fine town. Halifax is a&mdash;well, it would hardly do
for polite ears to hear what he thought of Halifax. I finally
edged around my new found friend and left him standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
in the middle of the road still telling of his adventures.
He was one of the most willing talkers I have met in some
time.</p>

<p>The way to Petite Riviere, which was possibly seven or
eight miles, does not seem to have left any impression. It
was probably a wood road, and much like other wood roads
that had gone before.</p>

</div>


<p>The Sperry House down by the water at Petite Riviere
is another of those pleasant homes for wayfarers. Both
the master and mistress can find time to be agreeable, and
are kindly people. The situation of the house is such that
the roar of the breakers on the outer bar is always to be
heard, and their whitening tops can readily be seen from
the upper windows as they are dashed to pieces upon the
breakwater. It is one of those hotels that believes in deeds
rather than words. There is no sign on house or grounds
to indicate its object in life, though the building is almost
out of sight from the road and the stranger would never
suspect its calling.</p>

<p>A fog held the region in thrall at the time of my arrival
and the two hours of daylight that remained did not produce
much beyond a ground-glass effect, a shadowy foreground
with the distance as blank as the mind of an ox.</p>

<p>The Sperry House is the first place where cream has
been put on the table. The past summer was very dry,
and the cows have not been giving much milk, and now that
the rainy season has arrived most of the milk looks as
though the cows were drinking over much.</p>

<p>In the days when eyes were less stigmatic and people
saw things as they really were, those outward bound from
Petite Riviere would, in the fall of the year, sometimes see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
a full rigged bark sail in on Crescent Beach, some two or
three miles to the eastward, pass over the beach and continue
on among the Lahave Islands, where it was lost to
view. No one ever discovered its exact destination, though
it was presumed to be the ghost of some pirate ship returning
for buried gold.</p>

<p>It may possibly have been bound for Fort Point at the
mouth of the Lahave River, where many have dug for
buried treasure in times past. Why the vessel always
came across the beach and never took the channel does not
appear, but it may be that in the early days there was an
opening in the sand near its western end and the ghost,
being a creature of habit, merely followed the old routine.</p>

<p>Once there was a lily pond in Petite Riviere in which it
was generally supposed gold had been deposited for safe
keeping, as the headless ghost of a woman was seen frequently
patrolling its banks. But one day the pond was
drained, and though no money was found the ghost was satisfied,
as she has not been known to appear in the neighborhood
since; possibly it was fairy gold and, with the weight
of the water removed, the ghost was herself able to make
away with it.</p>

<p>The boys of Petite Riviere appear to be much like boys
of other parts, not particularly bad nor yet altogether
given over to Sunday-school work. My host in going over
the annals of the town dwelt at some length on certain
plum trees that did particularly well by him last year. It
seems that the boys of this neighborhood have a taste for
plums and, as stolen fruit is much the sweeter, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to raid the orchard. In some mysterious way the owner
learned of the intended foray and, being a man of resource,
proceeded to set a trap for the invaders. First some pans
were arranged on the top of a summer house with a string
attached that would give warning of any visit, and next a
long cod trawl line, to which he added extra hooks, was
laid in the grass entirely around the orchard. This was
arranged so that a strong pull would elevate it about twenty
inches above the ground.</p>

<p>In due time the pans signaled “S.O.S.,” and with a pull
on the cod line the crowd was encircled. Then, not caring
how much noise he made, the owner went out to greet his
visitors but they, becoming suddenly shy, scattered or attempted
to. Then it was that the heavy cod hooks caught
the clothing of certain among them, and three who were
firmly hooked remained to give him welcome. These he
calmly inspected with a light and, after giving them full
instructions in the art of being good, hastened their departure.
For the remainder of the time those plums were
on the trees they were treated with the greatest respect.</p>

<p>The western side of Petite Riviere cove terminates in
what is known as Cape Lahave, and thereabout hangs a
tale that I cannot vouch for, owing to lack of time for careful
investigation. From the earliest times there have been
traditions of buried money here, and many have searched
though few have found. However, if what follows is a correct
statement of the case, two men were successful up to
a certain point. What manner of bargain they struck with
the Evil One my informant did not know, and both of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
adventurers being away on the Banks, nothing of this
could be learned, but the powers of darkness did permit
them to discover a chest buried in the sand. When the
earth had been removed and the coffer with great labor
lifted from the hole, the lid was raised and great store of
treasure exposed: gold, silver and all manner of precious
stones.</p>

<p>In such a search as this, digging must not begin before
the clock strikes the hour of midnight and, if found,
the treasure must be safely housed before cockcrow, while
during the entire period a single word spoken breaks the
spell and all is lost. The successful treasure-hunters were
greatly elated, and immediately started home with their
prize, but just as they reached the goal one unfortunately
stubbed his toe. It was a mighty stub and, forgetting all
else, he made a few emphatic and pointed remarks, when
immediately the chest and all it contained vanished in air.
What his companion remarked is best left unsaid; it was
no balm to his feelings to know that the Devil, repenting of
his bargain, had deliberately placed a stone in the path for
the very purpose which the stubbed toe accomplished.</p>

<p>Both men returned the next night, but were unable to
find the spot or any evidence of digging, and never since
then has the eye of mortal been allowed to see that chest.</p>

<p>During the night I awoke occasionally to listen to the
rain which came down in great volume. The incessant roar
of the surf on the bar, the whistling of the wind and dashing
of rain squalls against the side of the house aroused
thoughts of the morrow which were of a damnifying sort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
but when the morning had half gone the rain ceased, and
I set forth only, however, to become involved in a series
of showers that punctured the hours which followed until
two o’clock was no more.</p>

<p>The jaunt from Petite Riviere was possibly the most
captivating of the entire trip. At first the roar of a heavy
surf breaking within two to five hundred feet of the road
commanded the undivided attention, and when the rush and
clamor of the heavier breakers came the very air was
jarred and the noise was appalling, the more so because
nothing was visible beyond the dense fringe of spruce
which bordered the road. So heavy were the reverberations
among the trees that I was tempted two or three
times to investigate, only to find that it was merely heavy
surf and nothing more, but back among the trees there was
at times a crash that almost made the heart stand still;
it seemed as though the next instant the waters would be
upon one. What it may be like when the wild old Atlantic
is really worked up over some windy suspiration is beyond
comprehension.</p>

<p>Finally the woods fell away and Crescent Beach came
into view, a long curving sandbar thrown up by the sea
with quiet water on one side and the surf pounding on the
other. This introduces the traveler to West Dublin and
Dublin Shore at the mouth of the Lahave River, a stretch
of some five miles.</p>

<p>At first the waters are quiet, owing to the protection of
Crescent Beach, the shore is a series of enchanting little
coves and promontories with rocks and small craggy trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
distractingly picturesque. Then the road dodges away
from the shore for a half mile, only to come back to it again
where cod flakes line the way and little storehouses, through
whose open doors one can see men piling dried cod as the
farmer might fill his shed with the winter’s supply of firewood.</p>

<p>Then the bank becomes a bluff and the road ascends
thirty to forty feet above the water, while the waves, no
longer restrained by Crescent Beach, dash themselves on
the rocks below, a beautiful, rugged bit of coast. It is not
possible to adequately describe this wonderful five miles.
All the way houses are grouped or dotted along one side
of the road; it is like a straggling village street; while on
the other the shore stirs one’s heart with its beauty or its
rugged features or its interesting evidences of the life of the
fishing banks. It is seldom that the traveler finds so much
that is interesting and attractive in one short stretch.</p>

<p>Fort Point is situated at the outlet of the Lahave River
on its Western bank. I presume that it is included in the
village of Dublin Shore, but, as these villages run one into
the other in a most promiscuous fashion, it may come
within the confines of Getsans Point. In 1755 an Acadian
village stood here, nothing of which now remains but a few
almost obliterated depressions that were once the cellars
of the French homes.</p>

<p>Immediately back of the little lighthouse lies a pond
in which, according to local tradition, the Acadians placed
the church bell and silver service at the time of the expulsion.
These are still believed to lie deep in the mud. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
mud, I was told, is from ten to twenty feet deep. Some attempts
have been made to probe it with long poles, but
without results.</p>

<p>I found two men working in a field nearby, who were
quite ready to act as guides, and they, with the lightkeeper,
took me over the locality and helped find in the brush near
the pond the foundations of the chapel and priest’s house
and the well close by. These are such slight elevations and
so overgrown that the stranger might easily not recognize
his discovery when made.</p>

<p>The fort which gives name to the point stood on its
south side, which is elevated fifteen feet above the water.
The land here has been washed away within the memory
of my guides, until the remains of the fort have entirely
disappeared. A few thin, crudely made bricks were picked
up on the beach, which may have been used to line a fireplace,
but other than this no remnant of the fort is to be
found.</p>

<p>In times past will-o’-the-wisp lights have been seen to
come and go on the opposite shore of the river below
Riverport, but what they portended or why they are not
seen in these degenerate days, my new found friends did
not know. It has occurred to me that possibly these may
be the returned spirits of moose and bear endeavoring to
wreak a last revenge on the intruding white man. If the
legend which follows is true, this is at least a plausible explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>The earliest French settlement here was in 1613. There
is an Indian legend which relates that when these white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
men landed the bears and moose held a grand conclave
around the headwaters of the Lahave River, some fifty
miles in the interior, where they entered into an alliance
against the paleface. It was determined that the moose
should wage war against all cornfields planted by the intruders,
while the bears attacked their cattle and sheep,
but no person was to be eaten by them unless he bore a
gun which made a great noise and carried confusion among
the peaceable denizens of the wood.</p>

<p>The place of this meeting was known as “Ponhook,”
which is said to mean “outlet”&mdash;presumably of some lake&mdash;but
exactly where it was is not now known, though it is
still guarded by two bears and two moose which are invulnerable,
and not subject to the ills which beset their less
favored brethren when the hunting season is on. Since
this treaty no bear has been known to attack a moose, however
young and defenseless it may be. It is said the Indians
now believe that it would have been better for them
if they too had entered the alliance, as the white man has
made laws which at least protect the moose.</p>

<p>A brief note in one of the histories states that in 1632
Chevalier Isaac de Razilly, acting as agent for a French
company which had been organized by Cardinal Richelieu
to exploit the fisheries of Acadie, came across the seas with
forty families, which were settled at what is now known
as Fort Point, at the mouth of the Lahave River (more
properly <em>La Héve</em>).</p>

<p>About 1654 Emmanuel le Borgne, a merchant of Rochelle,
came to Acadie and, after the gentle manner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
times, some of his men set fire to all the buildings at La
Héve, not even sparing the chapel. The loss was estimated
at 100,000 francs. Some time later the son of Le Borgne
entered the harbor and constructed a fort of timber, whereupon
the English undertook to dislodge the French. Le Borgne
promptly sought the cover of the woods with some
of his men, but a trader who was with him, one Gilbaut, defended
the place with such vigor that many of the English
were killed and the remainder driven off. They were preparing
to attack again when Gilbaut, who had no interest
except in his goods, proposed to surrender on condition
that he and his men should be allowed to retain their possessions.
This was readily agreed to, and the fort fell
without further bloodshed. Le Borgne, who was quickly
starved out, desired to be included in the surrender and
granted the same terms, but as he had run away before the
fight began, the English failed to see the force of his
claims, and carried him off a prisoner.</p>

<p>In 1684 M. Perrot, the Governor of Acadie, proposed to
fortify and settle La Héve under certain conditions, but
apparently nothing was done in the matter.</p>

</div>


<p>After a brief search I found a ferryman who would
set me across the Lahave to Riverport. The ferryboat was
a dory, and this was the first time that I had seen a dory
without centerboard sailed to windward. The boatman
stood or sat forward of midships, passing the sheet
through an after tholepin hole and holding the end of it in
one hand, while with the other he manipulated an oar on
the lee side of the boat so that it was both rudder and sideboard,
and thus the boat sailed fairly well into the wind
without sliding off to too great an extent. Later I learned
that this is the manner of sailing a dory employed by the
fishermen on the Banks when looking after their trawls.</p>

<p>By this time the storm was breaking and the sun was
dodging the flying clouds, the wind was in the west and
there was such life and vigor in the atmosphere as had not
been present before at any time during the trip. Here I saw
the process of cleaning drying cod. During damp weather
the cod accumulate a shine that must be removed, and men
go over each fish with a scrubbing brush and fresh water, a
very considerable task and one which the fishermen do not
like.</p>

<p>The road from Riverport to Lunenburg passes through
the usual spruce forest and shortly comes out on an arm of
Lunenburg Bay, after which it was a bit of woods or a bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of water until First South was reached. First South and
its suburbs consist of a scattering line of houses at least
two miles long, with the road winding in and out along the
edge of the beach. Much cod was spread for the rays of the
newly found sun, and here and there the dried fish had been
piled by the road side with a wealth of salt, ready to be
stored or shipped. The entire stretch was picturesque to
a degree.</p>

<p>Lunenburg was settled by Hanoverian immigrants in
1751, and is still largely German in character. It is the
important fishing station of Nova Scotia and has grown
so great that it is known as “the Gloucester of Canada,”
and claims to send out more fishing vessels even than the
mother of fishermen.</p>

<p>The place had its troubles during the American War
for Independence, as did other towns along this coast.
On July 1, 1782, a privateer from Boston sailed into the
bay and landed ninety men and some guns for an attack.
They were fired on from the block house, but this does not
appear to have delayed their progress to any alarming extent,
for they soon captured the guns, which were promptly
spiked, after which they proceeded to plunder the town of
all that seemed good to them. After they were satisfied
that there was nothing more to take they threatened to
burn the houses unless a ransom was paid. There was,
of course, no money, but they were given a document which
purported to be a note for £1,000. The entire loss to the
town was placed at £10,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Mack searched me out shortly after my arrival, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
announced that he had intended to devote some part of
the morrow to my enlightenment on local matters, but the
fates had decreed otherwise. The customs collector at the
village of Mahone Bay was no more, and it devolved on
my friend to keep the wheels running until a new inspector
could be selected. He must drive up, nine miles, the first
thing on the following morning, and would be glad to have
me go with him. In the meantime he would walk about the
town with me in the evening, and again by the early morning
light.</p>

<p>I had a note to the effect that the old rectory here was
formerly a tavern and that occasionally the spirit of a
woman appears to its inmates. This is said to have happened
to people who had never heard of the story and whose
imagination could not have been prepared in advance. The
origin is supposed to lie in some murder long ago, but of
this nothing is known. It was my intent to ask somewhat
of this but, strange to say, I neglected to do so.</p>

<p>The present-day interest of Lunenburg centers about
its wharves and shipping. The town lies on such a steep
hillside that the parallel streets are only one hundred and
twenty feet apart, and everywhere one looks down on the
harbor. At this particular time a large fleet of fishermen
was lying at anchor in the quiet waters, waiting for the
weather to straighten itself out. Across the bay could be
seen the “Ovens,” curious caverns which are said to run
well back into the hill. Considerable gold has been washed
out of the sand here in the past.</p>

<p>If it were not for friend Mack I should be tempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
say mean things about the hotel in his town, where the
kitchen service is of a most exasperating character, greatly
accentuated by waitresses who have little of the Nova
Scotian spirit in their make-up. However, any hotel is but
an incident, and its discomforts are soon forgotten.</p>

<p>The drive to the village of Mahone Bay was interesting
in itself, and particularly so as my guide knew every foot
of the way. We passed a new venture for these parts, a
fox farm. Black foxes are worth $40,000 per pair, so I am
told, and it requires some capital to start such an enterprise,
but the promised profits are so enormous that the
necessary funds are readily obtainable. The raising of
foxes for their fur has been carried on in Prince Edward
Island with great success for some years, and there seems
no reason why it cannot be duplicated here.</p>

<p>Had I been dawdling along on foot, there were several
spots that could have tempted the camera from its seclusion.
But when the village of Mahone Bay was reached it
was unable to resist longer, for here the waters were so
quiet that even such a sober individual as myself saw double,
the village church was standing on its head in a fashion
quite apart from one’s notion of village church etiquette.</p>

<p>As I started up the hill with my back set toward Mahone
Bay there came another little experience of the courteous
spirit so frequently commented on. I was on the
wrong side of the road when one driving an ox team came
toward me. He promptly “geed” the animals across the
way in order to give me an abundance of room, and did it
in such a matter of course fashion as to clearly show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
such was his habit. Even the dogs so seldom run at the
passer-by that, when one does, it is a matter for comment.
I saw one well pounded merely because he dared bark at
me.</p>

<p>The day was perfect Indian summer weather, soft and
kindly, cloudy during the early morning hours, as seems
the fashion here, but by ten o’clock the clouds had vanished
and a gentle breeze from the west come to dull the edge of
the shafts with which a warm sun was assailing all creeping
things in this part of the globe. Later the clouds began
to assemble again, but merely for decorative purposes.</p>

<p>From the village of Mahone Bay the road crosses the
country to another cove of Mahone Bay through beautiful,
dark green woods or burned stretches where none but dead
trees kept watch and ward, through the villages of Martins
River, where I invested in apples and soda crackers for
lunch, and Martins Point, which put me in touch with the
water again, to Western Shore. My instructions were to
proceed to Gold River and there find some one to ferry me
across to Chester, but my fortunate habit of asking questions
led to the discovery that Oak Island was in sight; indeed,
had already been passed, and I was immediately
consumed with a desire to ferry from Western Shore.</p>

<p>James K. Manuel offered his boat and services, and we
immediately struck a bargain. The usual charge for the
three and one-quarter miles is seventy-five cents, but on my
suggestion it was made a dollar and we were to go by way
of Oak Island, the great mystery of Nova Scotia. Mahone
Bay is said to have been a one-time resort for pirates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
other gentle freebooters, who found its islands convenient
places behind which to hide their vessels; indeed, the
estimable Captain Kidd himself was a visitor here, so it
is claimed, and it is generally supposed that he used Oak
Island as a sub-treasury. Some gentleman with a turn for
figures has estimated that Captain Kidd’s treasure unearthed
so far amounts to $354,523,188.03. Just how he
arrives at these figures is of small moment, but they must
be exact, as he includes the cents. A few of the still undiscovered
millions are firmly believed to lie buried here.</p>

<p>Seekers after this easy money have digged pits all over
the place. Some of these have gone down one hundred
and fifty-six feet through layers of cut stone, and at a depth
of one hundred feet have found hewn oak timbers, strange
grasses from the tropics, charcoal, putty and carefully
joined planks. But while much capital has been expended
no treasure has been brought forth nor anything that might
solve the mystery. At the lower depths great stone drains
communicating with the sea were discovered. These admitted
the salt water more rapidly than it could be pumped
out; then divers were used, but all to no purpose. However,
as hope springs eternal, so one set of discouraged
seekers is replaced by a new lot of enthusiasts, who must
be convinced with their own convintion, and so it goes.</p>

<p>As is my habit I began right early to ask questions of
my ferryman, and among others, as to whether he had
ever heard of the <em>Teazer</em>. To this he promptly replied: “I
have seen it.” I gently reminded him that the privateer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
was blown up during the War of 1812, and he then told the
following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>When a lad, some fifty years ago, he and his father were
night-fishing off Peggys Cove on the southeastern shore of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margarets Bay. About ten o’clock he saw coming
toward them from Mahone Bay a full rigged ship on fire.
Much frightened, he spoke to his father, who said it was
nothing but the moon rising. He was old enough, however,
to know that the moon did not rise in the northwest. “I
was scared, but father didn’t mind it because he’d see it
lots of times.” The vessel approached within five hundred
feet of their small boat, and he could distinctly see men on
her deck and flames rising from all parts.</p>

<p>The man was evidently sincere in his belief that he had
seen the ghost ship; said she had been seen since by other
people, and always sailing out of the bay, never in. I had
heard the story before, it is common along this coast, and
it would seem probable that there is some occasional phenomenon
which, combined with a reasonably satisfactory
imagination, keeps it alive.</p>

<p>Passing out beyond Oak Island we saw in the distance a
“nubble” island which is struggling along without any
name. It was just beyond this I was informed that the
<em>Teazer</em> was blown up.</p>

<p>During the War of 1812 an American Privateer, the
<em>Young Teazer</em>, which had done much damage along this
coast, fled to the head of Mahone Bay in an effort to escape
a British cruiser, but being cornered she made a gallant
though losing fight, and was about to surrender when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
deserter from the British, who was among her crew, fired
the powder magazine, choosing to sacrifice all those on
board rather than meet the punishment which was surely
his if captured. The circumstances were so dramatic that
they made a lasting impression on the little communities of
the locality.</p>

<p>The day was so ideally perfect that my ferryman was
compelled to row the entire distance, though his small leg-of-mutton
helped some. He was a nice, garrulous party
who does anything, from helping his son-in-law kill his pig
to fishing on the Grand Banks; when nothing else occupies
his attention and the ferry business is dull he gathers kelp
and eel grass for fertilizer.</p>

<p>We poked along, passing island after island, several of
them already owned by “Americans,” as those of the
United States are called here, and I not caring how much
time was consumed, asked very particularly after exact locations,
got out my pocket map in order to be certain that
I understood and in all ways interrupted the rowing as
much as possible. Had time been of no moment I should
have bargained with my boatman for a period of hours,
and drifted over the waters for the remainder of the pleasant
spell of weather, in spite of the fact that son-in-law
upset in this same boat the other day and ruined a perfectly
good thirty dollar watch. But as all things pass
away, even so did this Indian summer afternoon drift off
into the regions of memory.</p>

<p>If any reader ever arrives at Western Shore with intent
to be transported over the waters to Chester, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
should insist on James Manuel for a ferryman, not mind
how dirty his boat may be, ask enough questions to keep
the talk going and look as though he believes every word
he hears. And if he does not have one of the times of his
life, he should never be permitted to travel other than in
the soft embraces of a Pullman car.</p>

<p>Chester is a summer resort, beautifully situated and
all that, but I have a grudge against Chester and shall say
no good word for it. My lunch consisted of a few crackers
and apples procured at Martins River, a sawmill growth;
the train for Halifax left Chester at 5:35 o’clock, arriving
about 8 p. m. I dropped into the Lovett House about 4:30
o’clock for a bite to eat. The proprietor was not to be
found, only a crabbed suffragette sort of woman who did
not propose to take any trouble for strangers, and with
the statement that the waitress was out, she refused to
move a hand herself, though the tables were set and the
labor involved but trifling.</p>

</div>


<p>The walking is over; in order to spend a day in the
Evangeline country the railroad must do the speeding hereafter
and I must omit <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margarets Bay and all the interesting
country to Halifax. I should prefer to remain
a night at Peggys Cove in the hope that I too might see the
ghost of the <em>Teazer</em>, and there is Sambro, often mentioned
in the history of early times, and Ketch Harbor sounds
attractive, as does many another spot that holds out invitation
to the wanderer.</p>

<p>It can be taken as an axiom that anything different
from that which one is used to is singular; hence, when I
pass through a country that is everywhere riddled with
glacial boulders of all sizes and, in a distance of nearly
two hundred miles, see only one stone fence, and that but a
short piece, it seems odd to me, used to such things, that at
least the smaller stones are not so disposed of. Another
singular matter is the lack of stone farm houses: not one
did I see in all my journeyings, when frequently all the
stone required could be gathered within a hundred yards
of its site. Had the Dutch settled in these parts it would
have been quite different.</p>

<p>Halifax is a nice little city but, from my point of view,
not worth an entire day of an all too short vacation. Another
time I should be inclined to cut out both Yarmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and Halifax and lay the time out dreaming the length of
some country road or drifting along the edge of one of the
beautiful bays.</p>

<p>The histories tell us that Halifax was settled in 1746
at the solicitation of the New England colonies, in order to
crowd out the French, who were inclined to use the harbor
as a naval base from which to harry said colonies. The
extensive fortifications on Citadel Hill are the pride of
Nova Scotia, but there is no attempt to make the hill attractive
outwardly. It is merely a rough pasture lot hillside,
crossed by wandering footpaths with a few uninteresting
cannon and fortifications in sight at the summit.</p>

<p>Dalhousie College is a monument to the War of 1812.
It seems that at that time certain patriotic Nova Scotians
moved over the borders into the eastern section of Maine,
and the inhabitants thereof, in order to continue their life
of ease and luxury, cheerfully took the oath of allegiance
to the British crown. The customs duties collected at the
port of Castine were kept when the land was surrendered
at the close of the war, and this money was known as the
“Castine Fund.” After much debate as to what should
be done with it, the entire amount was used for the endowment
of Dalhousie College.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Church is interesting from the fact, if it
is a fact, that the building was erected in circular form in
order that there might be no corners in which the Devil
could hatch mischief for such idle hands as might come
within the holy precincts, it would thus appear that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
who wish to avoid the machinations of the evil one should
avoid dark corners.</p>

<p>I took up my abode in the King Edward Hotel because
it was near the depot. This was satisfactory in most respects.
The head waiter did not fill his job very full, but
much can be forgiven any hotel that places before its patrons
that dear delight which the King Edward calls “pie,”
a rich stew of some fruit on which is placed a square of
rather thick, but very light and fluffy pastry. It is more
after the manner of some of the old Astor House “deep
dish” confections than any other that I know of, but, in
the language of the late Mr. Noah Webster, has even those
skinned a mile, all due to the remarkably light, flaky nature
of the pastry and exceeding richness of the cooked
fruit.</p>

<p>In the <em>Chronicle</em> office, Halifax, I met with another case
of Nova Scotian courtesy. Having been informed that
the paper had been publishing a series of articles on the
South Shore recently, I called to ascertain whether they
could be readily found, and saw an editor who kindly put
one of his young ladies at the task, and she, after some
searching, brought copies of the proper dates to me, and it
was all done with a ready willingness and a smile that
plainly meant she was glad to be of service. Why the
boys up here allow such girls to remain single after they
are sixteen can only be explained by the possible fact that
all the girls are much the same: such little experience as
I have had leads me to think this the probable explanation.</p>

<p>A morning train from Halifax put me in the “Evangeline”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
country by ten o’clock. I had hoped for a day in
Truro in order to thank in person T. S. Patillo, who was
kind enough to answer my written questions with good
advice as to the route best suited to my wishes, advice
which I followed with great satisfaction to myself. That I
did not see him is, however, wholly his own fault, in that he
suggested such an attractive course that I could not forsake
the country of his selecting one moment earlier than
must be.</p>

<p>Wolfville is the usual headquarters of those who wish
to see Grand-Pré, and there I found John Frederick Herbin,
the only descendant of the Acadians living in the
locality. He has made a study of the expulsion and the
causes which led to it, and claims that the poem “Evangeline”
is a remarkably correct page of history.</p>

<p>The following facts are taken from his book on the
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>Acadia was first settled in 1605, though it had been
known to French fishermen and traders since 1504.</p>

<p>Acadia, or Cadie or Kaddy, is a Micmac Indian terminal
meaning the place of; that is, a region, field, land, etc.</p>

<p>In 1636 dikes began to be used on the salt marshes.
About 1675 the French first settled in the Grand-Pré
neighborhood. The first inhabitants came from the west of
France&mdash;a country of marshes.</p>

<p>In 1704 Col. Benjamin Church left Boston to ravage
the coast. At Minas (this is part of the Minas country) he
cut the dikes, destroying the crops. He destroyed three villages
and burned many houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>In 1710 the English came into final possession of this
country, but the French never lost the hope of some day
regaining it. However, the Acadians, who by treaty right
could leave the country if they wished, prepared in 1713-14
to do so, but this would have stripped the country of inhabitants
and cattle and have left the English garrisons in
a sad predicament for their daily bread, and consequently
they by one pretext and another, managed to prevent it.
Up to 1730 every effort was made to compel the French to
take the oath of allegiance to the English Government, but
they “were remarkably faithful to the government”
(French).</p>

<p>In 1720 they again asked permission to leave, but were
prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>In 1730 they took the oath of allegiance, being exempted
from taking up arms against French or Indians. From
this date they were known as French Neutrals.</p>

<p>As an indication of their feeling in 1744, when other
French attempted unsuccessfully to force them into a position
antagonistic to the English, they responded in part:
“We live under a mild and tranquil government, and we
have every reason to be faithful to it.”</p>

<p>In 1749 the Acadians were called on to take the oath
without restriction or forfeit all their rights and possessions.</p>

<p>In 1750 they were pleading for permission to leave the
country.</p>

<p>“They bore insult and indignity for forty years in a
vain hope that a time would come when they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
finally secure on the lands their fathers had taken from
the sea and made beautiful and rich beyond any other in
America.”</p>

<p>The expulsion was the work of Governor Charles Lawrence,
who is characterized as the most infamous of all the
governors of Nova Scotia. “It was done without the sanction
of the English Government,” whose “orders forbidding
this action were received too late to prevent it.”</p>

<p>All their arms had been seized; their priests and
archives carried off.</p>

<p>Lawrence concealed his purpose from the English Government
until too late for its intervention; he even deceived
his own Lords of Trade at Halifax.</p>

<p>The male inhabitants were summoned to meet at the
church at Grand-Pré, “to hear the king’s orders.” Four
hundred and eighteen men gathered in the church. No
suspicion of danger had entered their minds up to the moment
when they were notified “That your Lands &amp; Tenements,
Cattle of all Kinds and Live Stock of all Sorts are
Forfeited to the Crown with all other your Effects Saving
your money and Household Goods, and you your Selves to
be removed from this his Province.” They were then declared
prisoners.</p>

<p>The expulsion was conceived in sin and carried out in
iniquity, its sole purpose being plunder, as the country
and wealth of the Acadians would then fall to the English.
Lawrence himself is accused of profiting greatly.</p>

<p>In other words, it was a plain case of highway robbery,
the only excuse being trumped up charges against the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>habitants
to the effect that they were plotting against the
English. These appear to have had no foundation in fact,
as has been amply proved by recent discoveries in the
archives of England and France. Under such circumstances
it was one of the most brutal cases of rapine, even
for those rough times, that can be found in history.</p>

<p>The little basin, known as Wolfville Harbor, offered my
best opportunity for noting the tremendous rise and fall
of the tide, though the basin itself is not deep enough to
show the extremes. Just outside, the greatest difference
between high and low water, the extremes only occurring
in spring and fall, is 55 feet 6 inches. But every full or
new moon there is a high tide that comes within a very few
feet of these figures. While interesting to see once, the
vast expanse of yellow mud and the thick muddy water
which surges back and forth destroy the beauty of the
waterside; its novelty is the only attraction.</p>

<p>For my ride to Grand-Pré I asked for a talkative
driver who knew the country and its story, and was given
one who filled my soul with great content.</p>

<p>Before arriving at the points of interest he told of two
ghosts seen by his father when a young married man&mdash;he
himself, of course, does not believe in ghosts, though it is
hard to explain their appearance to others. One brilliant,
moonlight night, when the ground was covered with snow,
father, while on his way to convoy his wife home from a
neighbor’s in Wolfville, saw two men come out of the woods
and pass through the fence to the road, neither climbing
over it nor letting down the bars, but as a puff of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
might pass. These started down the road a short distance
ahead of him, but made no noise on the hard, frozen snow,
while his shoes made the orthodox crunching sound as
shoes should on flesh and blood feet. He even stopped a
moment in order to assure himself of their quiet progress.
Whether he moved at a lively pace or slow, the figures
kept the same distance ahead of him, and even when he
broke into a run he was unable to overtake them. At last
they turned in toward a house, went up to the front door
and disappeared. Not having any fear of ghosts, father
followed, but found the door locked. He then passed
around to the back, to find the door there locked as well,
made some effort to arouse the people, but without success,
and finally went on his way. At this time a man lay sick
in the house who eventually died, and the ghost-seer always
believed that these had something to do with that event,
though unable to surmise how one man could have two
ghosts, as this was long before the days of Dr. Jekyl and
Mr. Hyde. It seems highly probable that the sick man had
a double personality, and that he was entitled to these two
spirits, who were identical in appearance and bearing.
This is the first time, so far as my knowledge goes, that
such a circumstance has occurred, but the more one thinks
on the subject the more reasonable does it seem.</p>

<p>At first we drove out on high land overlooking the
Gaspereau Valley, a sight well calculated to please the
lover of the beautiful. This valley is a noted apple growing
region, shipping about $60,000 worth of the fruit during
a normal year. Apples and potatoes are the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
product of this part of the country, and my driver stated
that the apple growers are prosperous and that few of the
orchards are mortgaged. All fruit has been shipped to
England heretofore, but the present Democratic free trade
antics of the United States will probably result in much of
it being sent to the nearer market to the detriment of its
apple growers; let us hope that they were among those who
helped mount the schoolmaster on the donkey’s back at
the late election, and that they will but receive their deserts.
More talk on this subject might be regarded by the
powers that be as apple-sauce, and in the interests of harmony
we will desist from further comment.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the Gaspereau River is the historic
landing place where the deportation of the helpless Acadians
was consummated.</p>

<p>After following down the river for a space we turned
to the left and mounted another hill, from the summit of
which one may look down on the village of Grand-Pré
(great prairie). Before beginning the descent we passed
the Scotch Covenanter Church, erected in 1804, which still
retains its box pews and high pulpit.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill we came out on the meadows
which were salved from the sea the better part of three
hundred years ago. Here stood the chapel in which the
Acadian men were held prisoners until they could be placed
on board the transports; the locality over which Longfellow
has woven such a spell of romance.</p>

<p>The site of the chapel, priest’s house and burial ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
was originally an island in the salt marsh; now it is merely
a gentle elevation on the edge of the meadow.</p>

<p>The Evangeline well is presumably the well attached to
the priest’s house. After the deportation it was filled up
and plowed over for many years. Twenty-five years ago it
was opened and an interesting lot of Acadian implements
were found in the bottom.</p>

<p>The burial ground is marked by a large cross built of
stone used in the foundation of the church and the priest’s
house and in other Acadian cellars. Beneath it are three
graves and about it rest the remains of those who died in
Grand-Pré during its occupation by the people, about
eighty years.</p>

<p>Just north of the church site stands a row of willows set
out by the people of Evangeline’s day. These have stood
probably two hundred years, and shielded the Acadian
Chapel and the priest’s house from the north winds of
winter until 1755 when, after the removal of the Acadians,
the buildings were burned.</p>

<p>On returning to Wolfville I again interviewed Mr. Herbin,
and among other items gathered the following account
of a legend which has to do with one of the nearby villages:</p>

<p>Immediately after the expulsion a considerable number
of those who had escaped the clutches of the British, gathered
at what is now known as East Minas, on high ground
from which a large territory could be overlooked, in the
belief that French ships would come for them. It is
claimed that they had a priest with them, though Mr. Herbin
regards this as doubtful, as the priests had been removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
from the country during the summer in anticipation
of the removal of the inhabitants later.</p>

<p>These are said to have erected a small chapel with walls
about six feet high and steep pitched roof. Here they
worshipped during the winter, but in time were discovered
by the English and forced to again flee. So sudden was
their departure that they were unable to carry with them
the silver service used in the chapel, which had been
brought from some other point, and this was hastily placed
for safe keeping in a spring of water conveniently near.</p>

<p>Many years passed, the chapel had crumbled and the
spring dried up, when several men appeared in the locality
and, after making much inquiry, located a great tree, the
stump of which is still to be seen, that was standing in the
days of the French. Taking a line by this and another
mark of which they appeared to have some record, they
passed into the forest, but were unable to find the site of
the spring, all signs of which having long since disappeared.</p>

<p>Later three men, who had learned the object of the unsuccessful
treasure-hunters, instituted a search on their
own account. One of them, named Bishop, stumbled on a
slight depression which he believed to be the dry bed of
the spring, and began to dig, but immediately the heavens
darkened and strange noises issued from the surrounding
woods, while half-seen shapes threatened to pounce upon
him from the nearby trees.</p>

<p>About this time he concluded not to be selfish over his
discovery, but to call in his friends that all might share
alike, and commenced a search for them with zealous haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
But when they endeavored to return to the spot he was not
able to locate it; the earth had been replaced and leaves
and sticks scattered over it as formerly, and even the trees
had been shifted about until the search was hopeless.</p>

<p>The novelty of the tides having worn off, the immense
mud flats left by the outgoing water and the railroad ride
from Wolfville to Yarmouth convinced me that I had followed
good advice in selecting the south shore for my jaunt.
Not that the Annapolis Valley is other than beautiful and
well kept, it is both, and the Fundy tides are interesting,
but to travel with day after day their muddied waters and
wastes of yellow flats cannot be compared with the sparkle
of the clean waters of the Atlantic and its rock-encrusted
coast line, innumerable harbors and occasional beautiful
stretches of wave-swept sand beach.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
